            A bonsai tree is a living tree or shrub which has been grown in a
            way which gives the impression of being a full-sized, mature tree.

            trees are generally grown in shallow ceramic pots.

      <h3>How to Position Your Bonsai Tree</h3>

      <p>
        To find the perfect location for your bonsai, it's crucial to identify
        the type of tree you have and its ideal environment. For outdoor bonsai,
        like juniper and pine, exposure to the seasons is essential, while
        deciduous trees like elms and maples also thrive outdoors. Indoor
        bonsai, such as jade and ficus trees, require stable temperatures
        throughout the year to thrive.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you have identified the type of bonsai you have, you can select the
        best location for it. Outdoor bonsai will need to be placed in areas
        with appropriate sun exposure and airflow, while indoor bonsai will
        require a stable environment with indirect sunlight. Proper placement
        will ensure that your bonsai thrives and brings beauty to your space.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once you’ve figured out what type of bonsai tree you have, the rest is
        fairly simple. Here are some general tips on bonsai tree positioning
        that typically apply to all types of bonsai trees.
      </p>
      <div>
        <p>
          Positioning: Your bonsai should be kept away from direct heat or
          draft.
        </p>
        <p>Lighting: Keep your bonsai in area with plenty of sunlight.</p>
        <p>
          Humidity: Bonsais need humidity in order to keep their soil moist.

      <h3>Watering Your Bonsai Tree</h3>

        src="https://www.ftd.com/blog/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fi3tkg7dt3kro%2F4uzjMSjmRYe90n7yjJDDWU%2Fb9da189d881d3c178c488e202a6220bc%2Fwatering-bonsai.jpg&w=1920&q=75"
        alt="watering"
      />
      <p>
        The primary cause of bonsai tree death is often due to under-watering.
        Because of the shallow soil layer, it can dry out quickly. To prevent
        this, it's important to water your bonsai tree as soon as the top layer
        of soil appears dry. Depending on the size and type of your bonsai tree,
        watering frequency can vary and may need to be done daily. Therefore,
        it's essential to water each bonsai plant individually, rather than
        sticking to a set routine.
      </p>
      <p>
        When watering your bonsai tree, the goal is to saturate the root system
        fully. You'll know you've done this when water escapes through the
        draining holes. Many bonsai trees come with a tray to collect excess
        water to allow for proper draining. Overwatering can be just as harmful
        to your bonsai tree as under-watering, resulting in yellowing leaves and
        shriveling branches. To ensure proper watering, assess your bonsai tree
        daily and water it as soon as the soil appears dry.

      <h3>Pruning and Shaping Your Bonsai Tree</h3>

        src="https://www.ftd.com/blog/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fi3tkg7dt3kro%2F5wr5JGiNziIHHtzU6G5cBw%2F6162627dab521505430091d26b1f448f%2Fpruning-bonsai.jpg&w=1920&q=75"
        alt="pruning"
      />
      <p>
        Pruning is a crucial aspect of bonsai tree maintenance, necessary to
        keep the tree small and maintain its compact shape. There are two types
        of pruning: maintenance pruning and structural pruning.
      </p>
      <p>
        Maintenance pruning stimulates new growth and strengthens the tree by
        cutting away young shoots and leaves to expose the leaves underneath to
        air and sunlight. Pruning branches encourages the growth of smaller
        branches and allows for greater control of the tree's shape. Cutting
        away buds from branches produces a more compact leaf growth that
        encourages smaller leaves.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pruning should be done when you notice new growth that is starting to
        morph the tree's shape in an undesirable way. For flowering bonsais,
        prune during spring to encourage more flowers the following year.
        Structural pruning is an advanced technique best done during the dormant
        season and requires the skills of a professional to ensure the tree can
        recover properly. Another method of shaping the bonsai tree is wiring
        its branches during winter when leaves have fallen off. Keep an eye on
        the branch's growth and remove the wire when necessary to avoid
        scarring.
      </p>
      <h3>Choosing the Right Soil For Your Bonsai</h3>
      <img
        src="https://www.ftd.com/blog/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fi3tkg7dt3kro%2F4o071gl51U7Wss9L96Kl6n%2F6f93eb12115b1817d5cf2d3fbdf02fff%2Fsoil-for-bonsai.jpg&w=1920&q=75"
        alt="soil"
      />
      <p>
        The key to choosing the right soil for your bonsai is to choose one that
        offers proper drainage. Add large particles to your soil mixture, such
        as volcanic rock or stones, to improve drainage and to introduce air
        into the soil. The ideal soil mixture should also be able to hold water
        which can be improved by adding clay.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fertilizing your bonsai ensures that it receives the proper amount of
        nutrients it needs to stay healthy. A balanced bonsai fertilizer
        contains equal amounts of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. Before you
        fertilize, make sure that you’ve watered your tree thoroughly as it is
        harmful to fertilize the plant while the soil is dry. Be sure to read
        the instructions on the fertilizer to avoid overfertilizing.
      </p>
      <h3>Repotting Your Bonsai</h3>
      <img
        src="https://www.ftd.com/blog/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fi3tkg7dt3kro%2F2XTaAvIdcGJIpGwP1wiG9y%2F7d4fea32ce8d2a5b7514f43cf4989e91%2Frepotting-bonsai.jpg&w=1920&q=75"
        alt="repotting"
      />
      <p>
        Repotting is a key factor in maintaining the health of your bonsai tree.
        The purpose of repotting is to remove excess roots which can cause the
        tree to starve, or not receive enough nutrients for its mass. Repotting
        also ensures that your tree can continue to thrive within a small pot.
        Bonsai trees should be repotted once every two to five years, depending
        on how quickly your bonsai tree grows.
