For outdoor bonsai,\n        like juniper and pine, exposure to the seasons is essential, while\n        deciduous trees like elms and maples also thrive outdoors. Indoor\n        bonsai, such as jade and ficus trees, require stable temperatures\n        throughout the year to thrive.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Once you have identified the type of bonsai you have, you can select the\n        best location for it. Outdoor bonsai will need to be placed in areas\n        with appropriate sun exposure and airflow, while indoor bonsai will\n        require a stable environment with indirect sunlight. Proper placement\n        will ensure that your bonsai thrives and brings beauty to your space.\n      </p>\n      <img\n        src=\"https://www.ftd.com/blog/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fi3tkg7dt3kro%2F41RHKuTKyAjNhJ1nqVps3O%2F62564a858c6a0456d2834bdae41e63cf%2Fbonsai-types.jpg&w=1920&q=75\"\n        alt=\"type\"\n      />\n      <p>\n        Once youâ€™ve figured out what type of bonsai tree you have, the rest is\n        fairly simple. Here are some general tips on bonsai tree positioning\n        that typically apply to all types of bonsai trees.\n      </p>\n      <div>\n        <p>\n          Positioning: Your bonsai should be kept away from direct heat or\n          draft.\n        </p>\n        <p>Lighting: Keep your bonsai in area with plenty of sunlight.</p>\n        <p>\n          Humidity: Bonsais need humidity in order to keep their soil moist.\n        </p>\n      </div>\n      <h3>Watering Your Bonsai Tree</h3>\n      <img\n        src=\"https://www.ftd.com/blog/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fi3tkg7dt3kro%2F4uzjMSjmRYe90n7yjJDDWU%2Fb9da189d881d3c178c488e202a6220bc%2Fwatering-bonsai.jpg&w=1920&q=75\"\n        alt=\"watering\"\n      />\n      <p>\n        The primary cause of bonsai tree death is often due to under-watering.\n        Because of the shallow soil layer, it can dry out quickly. To prevent\n        this, it's important to water your bonsai tree as soon as the top layer\n        of soil appears dry. Depending on the size and type of your bonsai tree,\n        watering frequency can vary and may need to be done daily. Therefore,\n        it's essential to water each bonsai plant individually, rather than\n        sticking to a set routine.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        When watering your bonsai tree, the goal is to saturate the root system\n        fully. You'll know you've done this when water escapes through the\n        draining holes. Many bonsai trees come with a tray to collect excess\n        water to allow for proper draining. Overwatering can be just as harmful\n        to your bonsai tree as under-watering, resulting in yellowing leaves and\n        shriveling branches. To ensure proper watering, assess your bonsai tree\n        daily and water it as soon as the soil appears dry.\n      </p>\n\n      <h3>Pruning and Shaping Your Bonsai Tree</h3>\n      <img\n        src=\"https://www.ftd.com/blog/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fi3tkg7dt3kro%2F5wr5JGiNziIHHtzU6G5cBw%2F6162627dab521505430091d26b1f448f%2Fpruning-bonsai.jpg&w=1920&q=75\"\n        alt=\"pruning\"\n      />\n      <p>\n        Pruning is a crucial aspect of bonsai tree maintenance, necessary to\n        keep the tree small and maintain its compact shape. There are two types\n        of pruning: maintenance pruning and structural pruning.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Maintenance pruning stimulates new growth and strengthens the tree by\n        cutting away young shoots and leaves to expose the leaves underneath to\n        air and sunlight. Pruning branches encourages the growth of smaller\n        branches and allows for greater control of the tree's shape. Cutting\n        away buds from branches produces a more compact leaf growth that\n        encourages smaller leaves.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Pruning should be done when you notice new growth that is starting to\n        morph the tree's shape in an undesirable way. For flowering bonsais,\n        prune during spring to encourage more flowers the following year.\n        Structural pruning is an advanced technique best done during the dormant\n        season and requires the skills of a professional to ensure the tree can\n        recover properly. Another method of shaping the bonsai tree is wiring\n        its branches during winter when leaves have fallen off. Keep an eye on\n        the branch's growth and remove the wire when necessary to avoid\n        scarring.\n      </p>\n      <h3>Choosing the Right Soil For Your Bonsai</h3>\n      <img\n        src=\"https://www.ftd.com/blog/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fi3tkg7dt3kro%2F4o071gl51U7Wss9L96Kl6n%2F6f93eb12115b1817d5cf2d3fbdf02fff%2Fsoil-for-bonsai.jpg&w=1920&q=75\"\n        alt=\"soil\"\n      />\n      <p>\n        The key to choosing the right soil for your bonsai is to choose one that\n        offers proper drainage. Add large particles to your soil mixture, such\n        as volcanic rock or stones, to improve drainage and to introduce air\n        into the soil. The ideal soil mixture should also be able to hold water\n        which can be improved by adding clay.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Fertilizing your bonsai ensures that it receives the proper amount of\n        nutrients it needs to stay healthy. A balanced bonsai fertilizer\n        contains equal amounts of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. Before you\n        fertilize, make sure that youâ€™ve watered your tree thoroughly as it is\n        harmful to fertilize the plant while the soil is dry. Be sure to read\n        the instructions on the fertilizer to avoid overfertilizing.\n      </p>\n      <h3>Repotting Your Bonsai</h3>\n      <img\n        src=\"https://www.ftd.com/blog/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fi3tkg7dt3kro%2F2XTaAvIdcGJIpGwP1wiG9y%2F7d4fea32ce8d2a5b7514f43cf4989e91%2Frepotting-bonsai.jpg&w=1920&q=75\"\n        alt=\"repotting\"\n      />\n      <p>\n        Repotting is a key factor in maintaining the health of your bonsai tree.\n        The purpose of repotting is to remove excess roots which can cause the\n        tree to starve, or not receive enough nutrients for its mass. Repotting\n        also ensures that your tree can continue to thrive within a small pot.\n        Bonsai trees should be repotted once every two to five years, depending\n        on how quickly your bonsai tree grows.\n      </p>\n\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default Home;\n","/Users/jsmith/Development/code/phase-2/phase-2-project/src/components/ContactMe.js",["66","67","68"],[],"function ContactMe() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"contact-me\" id=\"contact-me\">\n      <h3>You can find me on</h3>\n      <div className=\"contact-me-links\">\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/JosephDSmith\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <i className=\"fa-brands fa-github\"></i>\n        </a>\n        <a\n          href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/joseph-d-smith-692522264/\"\n          target=\"_blank\"\n        >\n          <i className=\"fa-brands fa-linkedin\"></i>\n        </a>\n        <a href=\"https://medium.com/@joesmith40\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <i className=\"fa-brands fa-medium\"></i>\n        </a>\n        <a href=\"mailto:joesmith40@gmail.com\">\n          <i className=\"fa-solid fa-envelope\"></i>\n        </a>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default ContactMe;\n","/Users/jsmith/Development/code/phase-2/phase-2-project/src/components/FAQs.js",[],[],{"ruleId":"69","severity":1,"message":"70","line":21,"column":11,"nodeType":"71","endLine":24,"endColumn":13},{"ruleId":"72","severity":1,"message":"73","line":1,"column":17,"nodeType":"74","messageId":"75","endLine":1,"endColumn":25},{"ruleId":"72","severity":1,"message":"76","line":1,"column":27,"nodeType":"74","messageId":"75","endLine":1,"endColumn":36},{"ruleId":"77","severity":1,"message":"78","line":28,"column":40,"nodeType":"79","messageId":"80","endLine":28,"endColumn":42},{"ruleId":"81","severity":1,"message":"82","line":38,"column":6,"nodeType":"83","endLine":38,"endColumn":30,"suggestions":"84"},{"ruleId":"85","severity":1,"message":"86","line":86,"column":11,"nodeType":"71","endLine":86,"endColumn":37},{"ruleId":"85","severity":1,"message":"86","line":133,"column":13,"nodeType":"71","endLine":133,"endColumn":40},{"ruleId":"85","severity":1,"message":"86","line":19,"column":11,"nodeType":"71","endLine":19,"endColumn":124},{"ruleId":"87","severity":1,"message":"88","line":6,"column":9,"nodeType":"71","messageId":"89","endLine":6,"endColumn":67,"fix":"90"},{"ruleId":"87","severity":1,"message":"88","line":9,"column":9,"nodeType":"71","messageId":"89","endLine":12,"endColumn":10,"fix":"91"},{"ruleId":"87","severity":1,"message":"88","line":15,"column":9,"nodeType":"71","messageId":"89","endLine":15,"endColumn":66,"fix":"92"},"jsx-a11y/img-redundant-alt","Redundant alt attribute.
